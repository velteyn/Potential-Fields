<h1>Potential Fields AS3 library</h1>

This library can be used for easy development of AI behaviors driven by potential fields. For more informations about potential fields theory I recommend you reading [Johan Hagelb√§ck's: Using Potential Fields in a Real-time Strategy Game Scenario](http://aigamedev.com/open/tutorials/potential-fields/).

I've written 3-part article about this library. Please refer it for API informations and usage examples. It could be found on my blog:
